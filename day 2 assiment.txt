
JSON - Introduction
HTML
JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data

JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

JSON Example
This example is a JSON string:

'{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'
It defines an object with 3 properties:

name
age
car
Each property has a value.

If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object:

let personName = obj.name;
let personAge = obj.age;


JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
JSON is used to send data between computers
JSON is language independent 
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:

JSON.parse()

JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:

JSON.stringify()

You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.

You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.

You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
screen.pixelDepth

THE DOCUMENT.

The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document
